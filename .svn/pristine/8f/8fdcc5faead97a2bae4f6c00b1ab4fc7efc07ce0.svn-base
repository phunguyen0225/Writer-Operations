code from SimpleRecursion to MemoizedRecursion, which we did not have to duplicate code.
to
code from SimpleRecursion to MemoizedRecursion, and thus we avoided duplicating code.


Another one is LSP, we followed this principle by implementing the MemoizedRecursion extends from SimpleRecursion. How is this LSP, how did it benefit us?
Is this the only place where we used LSP?

Where is DIP used here? We are discussing classes implementing an interface, but is this what DIP is?

synopsis: more use, more principles

details: 

"There are many principles that we applied during this project"
No, there were not many, there were a few. Should not exagerate.

Did we use DRY in another place as well.

There is no such things as polymorphism pillar. We used polymorphism.

Did we use any other principle that was discussed in week 8 or week 9 from

synopsis: let's check the tense and bring in more details

details: 

Please spellcheck.

"There are many principle that we applied during this" We used a few, let us mention what we used instead of exaggerating with many that we will not talk about.

"The DRY principle help us write" helped instead of help. Please visit the text to use past tense.

"test the test cases"  why are we testing the test cases?

Did we use DRY anywhere else?

Did we use any other principles?

For part 2, please write in short paragraphs.
