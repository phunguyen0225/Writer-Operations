details: 

Nice work so far. Please see suggestions in code.

Let us integrate the code to the GUI so that the GUI picks a random work and also handles wrong spelling properly.

Let's do a quick review after these changes. Please modify the requestReview.txt file and check it in as soon as you are ready and I will do a review well before the next scheduled review cycle.

Good so far.

That completes the design of the logic. Now, let us move on to design the code that talks to the service.

-getResponse takes a word as argument, calls the URL for the spell check service, and returns a text
-parse takes "true" and returns true
-parse takes "false" and returns false
-isSpellingCorrect, given a word, calls getResponse, passes result of getResponse to parse, returns result of parse
-isSpellingCorrect, given a word, passes the exception for Network Error from getResponse to the caller

synopsis~: let's rethink about the approach

details: 

Please see suggestions in tests.txt.

Here are a few tests as the next step:

-play first attempt with FAVRO as guess calls display with 0 for numberOfAttempts, Status ERROR, message "not a word"
-play second attempt with FVROA as guess calls display with 1 for numberOfAttempts, Status ERROR, message "not a word"
Please keep in mind the design goals: "Design in a way that if we decide to check the spelling using a different service in the future... rest of the details in assign2.txt..."
